This is version of the [100STYLE dataset](https://www.ianxmason.com/100style/) exported in both fbx and bvh format with a different skinned character applied.

The skinned character mesh is available in `Geno.fbx` and is free for non-commercial research use.

This dataset is compatible with:

* [lafan1-resolved](https://github.com/orangeduck/lafan1-resolved)
* [zeroeggs-retarget](https://github.com/orangeduck/zeroeggs-retarget)
* [motorica-retarget](https://github.com/orangeduck/motorica-retarget)
